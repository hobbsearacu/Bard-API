But before you can start using Plexus 2, you need to activate it with a serial number. A serial number is a unique code that verifies your purchase and unlocks the full features of the plugin. Without a serial number, you can only use Plexus 2 in trial mode, which has some limitations and watermarks.
 
So how do you find your Plexus 2 serial number? In this article, we will show you three easy ways to locate your serial number and activate your plugin.
 
## Method 1: Check Your Email
 
The simplest way to find your Plexus 2 serial number is to check your email. When you purchase Plexus 2 from the official website [https://aescripts.com/plexus/](https://aescripts.com/plexus/), you will receive an email confirmation with your order details and your serial number. The email will look something like this:

If you can't find the email in your inbox, try checking your spam or junk folder. You can also search for "aescripts" or "plexus" in your email client to narrow down the results.
